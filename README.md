## Overview

The Axehandle Hound is a creature from the fearsome critter tradition of American logging camps in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Described as having a head shaped like an axe blade and a body and legs shaped like axe handles, this absurd creature was said to exclusively eat wooden axe handles.

According to the tall tales, the Axehandle Hound would sneak into logging camps at night to chew and destroy the lumberjacks' tools. The creature represents classic occupational folklore, serving as a humorous explanation for missing or damaged equipment while providing entertainment and hazing greenhorns (new workers) in isolated lumber camps.
